            <p> I am a Designer and 3d Artist living in Salt Lake City. After earning a Master of Architecture in 2011,
                I
                began
                working in a small studio doing mostly graphic design. While at Dijt, now Freehive, I teamed up with a
                few
                other
                talented and multi-disciplined designers to complete
                works on a variety of feilds including graphic design, product design, industrial design, and 3d
                rendering
                and
                animation. Having gained some experience in 3d visualization from my
                time in architecture school, I developed my 3d talents to complete several
                visualization projects for product companies.

                In addition to my love of design, I am an avid hiker, skier, three time marathoner, and a huge soccer
                fan. I
                enjoy exploring the outdoors, working on my house, and watching soccer games with my wife and 9 month
                old
                son.
